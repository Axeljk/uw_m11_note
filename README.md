Type in a title and message in the main body. A save file icon should appear in the top-right, inside the nav bar. Saving the note will add it to the database (on the lefthand side).

Clicking on any of the notes in the database will let you view them in the main body. Click the "+" at the top-right of the screen to clear the main body if you wish to add another note.

Clicking the red trashcan on any note will delete it from the database.
